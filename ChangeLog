Version 0.5
    * New classes for EXPECT manipulation, Expect and ExpectEntry
    * Remove Conntrack.destroy_conntrack(), replaced by ConntrackEntry.destroy()
    * ConntrackEntry IP attributes are now of IPy.IP type
    * Replace conntrack entry "hashtuple" attribute by __hash__() method, so
      use hash(entry) to get hash value. Hash is now a classic hash value and
      not a tuple of integers.
